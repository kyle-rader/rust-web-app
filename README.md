# RustWebApp

Welcome to RustWebApp! An early-stage but solid template repository for building modern web applications using Rust on the server and SvelteJS on the frontend with an islands architecture.

# Architecture

This template implements a modern web application architecture with:

- **Backend**: Rust with Axum web framework, providing high-performance API endpoints
- **Frontend**: SvelteJS with TypeScript, offering reactive UI components
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Diesel ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system
- **Deployment**: Docker containerization with Fly.io deployment support
- **Development**: Hot reload for both frontend and backend development

The template follows an islands architecture pattern, allowing for server-side rendering with selective client-side hydration where needed.

# Developer Setup

This template provides a solid foundation for building web applications with Rust backend and SvelteJS frontend. While still in early development, it includes the essential components needed to get started. It can be developed locally on your host of choice, or entirely on Docker. We minimally use Docker to run local development databases.

> ü™ü **Windows** - I highly recommend using WSL - the Windows Subsystem for Linux, which Docker can also use for it's backend.
> 
> See [setup WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

## Install Tools

Install the following for your platform first.

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - for version control
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) - for running containers locally
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - <abbr title="Integrated Developer Experience">IDE</abbr> for editing code

### Host Development Tools

These tools are already installed in our [base docker image](./docker/rustwebapp.base.dockerfile).

* [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) - the language used for the back end server
* NodeJS + TypeScript - for the front end client
   
   Recommend using an installation manager
   * MacOS/Linux/WSL: [mise](https://github.com/jdx/mise)
   * Windows: [nvm](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) or [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) directly.

## Get the code

### Authentication

I recommend using SSH auth with GitHub.

See [GitHub SSH Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) for details.

TL;DR

```shell
~> ssh-keygen -t RSA -C YOUR_EMAIL -b 4096
# enter
# enter

# Keys created in ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

# Copy ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# Go to https://github.com/settings/keys
# Add New SSH Key
# Paste Key

# Test auth by running
~> ssh git@github.com -T

# If it works you should see
Hi YOUR_USER_NAME! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

### Clone the repo

```shell
git clone git@github.com:kyle-rader/rustwebapp.git
cd rustwebapp
```

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository** (see above)
2. **Set up your development environment** (see Developer Setup below)
3. **Start the development servers**:
   ```shell
   docker-compose up
   ```
4. **Access your application**:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
   - Backend API: http://localhost:3000
5. **Customize the template**:
   - Update the application name and branding
   - Modify the database schema in `server/migrations/`
   - Add new API endpoints in `server/src/web/routes/`
   - Create new Svelte components in `client/src/lib/components/`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This template is still in early development. While it provides a solid foundation, you may encounter rough edges or missing features. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

## Develop

### On Docker

```shell
# Launch with all logs attached in the foreground
docker-compose up

# Launch in the background and then attach to logs
docker-compose up -d
```

Go to
```
http://localhost:3000
```

You should be redirected to `http://localhost:5173`.
In development we do not bundle assets and run a separate front-end live reload server with Vite.

### Host Development
