# Architecture Guides

These guides walk through the first 3 levels of the [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) model of diagramming software architecture: Context, Containers, and Components. We won't focus on Code (class level diagrams) because that information is mostly understandable through the tests and the code itself.

## Audience

Sections tagged with `[background]` are intended for readers with little to no experience developing web applications.

## Terminology

* **<abbr title="Automata Games">AG</abbr>** = Automata Games.
* **<abbr title="Database">DB</abbr>** = Database

# Guides

## [Level 1: AG System Context](architecture/level1_context.md)
## [Level 2: Containers Within AG](architecture/level2_containers.md)

Many thanks to [this great blog post](https://dev.to/buhrmi/setting-up-a-new-rails-7-app-with-vite-inertia-and-svelte-c9e) by [Stefan Buhrmester](https://dev.to/buhrmi) for providing a great guide on the initial use of Rails + Svelte with Vite + InertiaJS. For a step by step guide on starting this architecture from scratch, read that blog post! (It does not cover adding Rodauth-Rails or account management.)
